# I'm running for Secretary of CompSoc at the 2025 AGM!
I've uploaded my [manifesto here](/secretary-manifesto.pdf) (compiled in Typst) and also included the contents below.

## Manifesto
Hey! I'm reaching the end of my first year at Edinburgh, and next year I want to help keep CompSoc running smoothly as secretary. CompSoc has been one of the best parts of university for me, and I want to make sure we can continue to provide incredible opportunities for future years.


### Aims
As secretary I intend to maintain high levels of transparency about committee decisions and good communications between all parts of the society. It's important to me that things don't just run smoothly, but that everyone can have a say in CompSoc affairs and know what's going on with them.

### Why me?
I previously founded and co-ran my 6th Form tabletop games society, where I was often the person who communicated with staff. Personally I'm a very organised person, I have always enjoyed talking to people and I'm quite experienced at keeping plans running smoothly.

### New plans
I'd also work with the future social sec to push for more, smaller socials such as pub nights and the return of board games nights. I'd like to open suggestions for more merch ideas as well and see what people come up with.


Thanks for reading and I hope you consider me for secretary!

Alex
